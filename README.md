# Type stubs for the Google Ads API Client
This package provides type stubs for the [Google Ads API Client Library for Python](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python). It's currently compatible with v.3.1.2 of this library.

While some of the annotations are created manually, most are generated automatically by homemade scripts and [mypy-protobuf](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf).
